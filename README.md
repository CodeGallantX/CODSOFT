# CODSOFT Internship Projects

Below, you'll find details about the tasks I've successfully completed:

## Completed Tasks

### 1. [To-Do List Application](#To-Do-List-Application)
Created a command-line or GUI-based To-Do List application using Python. This application allows users to manage and organize tasks efficiently, including features for creating, updating, and tracking tasks.

### 2. [Calculator](#calculator)
Designed a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations using Python. The application prompts users to input two numbers and an operation choice, performs the calculation, and displays the result.

### 3. [Password Generator](#password-generator)
Developed a password generator application using Python. Users can specify the desired length and complexity of the password, and the application generates a strong and random password accordingly.

### 4. [Rock-Paper-Scissors Game](Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game)
Implemented the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python. The application prompts users to choose rock, paper, or scissors, generates a random choice for the computer, determines the winner based on the selections, and displays the result.

## To-Do List Application

The To-Do List Application is a simple tool for managing tasks. It allows users to add, remove, and view tasks in a list format.

### Usage

1. **Add Task**: Enter task description and due date to add a new task to the list.
2. **Remove Task**: View existing tasks and enter the task description to remove it from the list.
3. **View Tasks**: Display all tasks currently in the list along with their descriptions, due dates, and statuses.
4. **Exit**: Quit the application.

## Password Generator
The Password Generator project aims to create a tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. It allows users to specify the desired length of the password and generates a password containing a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and special characters.

### Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Enter 
3. The script will generate and display the password.
4. Enter 'Q' to exit the application.

## Calculator
The Calculator project implements a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by entering two numbers and selecting the desired operation.

### Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Select the desired arithmetic operation.
3. Enter two numbers.
4. The script will calculate and display the result.
5. Enter '5' to exit the calculator.

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a classic hand game played between two players, typically you and the computer. The objective is to choose a handshape that defeats your opponent's choice.

### Usage

1. **Playing the Game**: Enter 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' to make your choice.
2. **Exiting the Game**: Enter 'exit' to quit the game.

### How it Works

1. The game starts by prompting you to make a choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the choices.
3. The winner is determined based on the following rules:
   - Rock crushes scissors.
   - Scissors cuts paper.
   - Paper covers rock.
4. The result is displayed, indicating whether you win, lose, or it's a tie.
5. You can continue playing by making another choice or exit the game.

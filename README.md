# CODSOFT Internship Projects

Below, you'll find details about the tasks I've successfully completed:

## Completed Tasks

### 1. [To-Do List Application](#To-Do-List-Application)
Created a command-line or GUI-based To-Do List application using Python. This application allows users to manage and organize tasks efficiently, including features for creating, updating, and tracking tasks.

### 2. [Calculator](#calculator)
Designed a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations using Python. The application prompts users to input two numbers and an operation choice, performs the calculation, and displays the result.

### 3. [Password Generator](#password-generator)
Developed a password generator application using Python. Users can specify the desired length and complexity of the password, and the application generates a strong and random password accordingly.

### 4. [Rock-Paper-Scissors Game](Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game)
Implemented the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python. The application prompts users to choose rock, paper, or scissors, generates a random choice for the computer, determines the winner based on the selections, and displays the result.

### 5. Contact Book
Built a contact book application using Python. This application allows users to store and manage contact information, including name, phone number, email, and address. Features include adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contacts.

## To-Do List Application

The To-Do List Application is a simple tool for managing tasks. It allows users to add, remove, and view tasks in a list format.

### Usage

1. **Add Task**: Enter task description and due date to add a new task to the list.
2. **Remove Task**: View existing tasks and enter the task description to remove it from the list.
3. **View Tasks**: Display all tasks currently in the list along with their descriptions, due dates, and statuses.
4. **Exit**: Quit the application.

## Password Generator
The Password Generator project aims to create a tool that generates strong and random passwords for users. It allows users to specify the desired length of the password and generates a password containing a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and special characters.

### Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Enter 
3. The script will generate and display the password.
4. Enter 'Q' to exit the application.

## Calculator
The Calculator project implements a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations. Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by entering two numbers and selecting the desired operation.

### Usage:
1. Run the script.
2. Select the desired arithmetic operation.
3. Enter two numbers.
4. The script will calculate and display the result.
5. Enter '5' to exit the calculator.

## Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

The Rock-Paper-Scissors Game is a classic hand game played between two players, typically you and the computer. The objective is to choose a handshape that defeats your opponent's choice.

### Usage

1. **Playing the Game**: Enter 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' to make your choice.
2. **Exiting the Game**: Enter 'exit' to quit the game.

### How it Works

1. The game starts by prompting you to make a choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
2. The computer randomly selects one of the choices.
3. The winner is determined based on the following rules:
   - Rock crushes scissors.
   - Scissors cuts paper.
   - Paper covers rock.
4. The result is displayed, indicating whether you win, lose, or it's a tie.
5. You can continue playing by making another choice or exit the game.
